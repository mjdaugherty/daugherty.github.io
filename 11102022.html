				Buzzard Rock is an awesome rock formation on the northern end of Massanutten Mountain, just across Fort Valley from Signal Knob. In fact, it is visible from the trail leading up to Signal Knob. There are incredible views all along the trail to Buzzard Rock. It is also a popular area for rock climbers with several routes ranging from moderate to difficult. The photo shows the view into Fort Valley with Crisman Hollow Road (FR 274) visible. Passage Creek is also down there somewhere, hidden in the trees.
