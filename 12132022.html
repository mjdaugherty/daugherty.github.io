				On this chilly day I had originally planned to do a loop including both Duncan Knob and Strickler Knob, around 10 miles. On the way to Duncan Knob I got sidetracked by an interesting rock formation just off the trail and didn't have enough time to head up to both mountains. I decided to pass by Duncan Knob and hit up Strickler Knob, figuring that the late-afternoon views from the latter location would be the best. I found the section of the Gap Creek trail going back down the other side of Catback Mountain to be much steeper and more difficult than I expected, and the section of the Massanutten loop trail heading south toward the end of the mountain took me a long time. I had to hurry a bit to make it to Strickler Knob and have time to eat and enjoy the view, which was no less spectacular than when I stood in this same spot two months before.
