				The weather on this day was unbelievable, with temperatures in the 60s and blue skies and a light breeze. The birds were chirping and it felt like spring. I saw only one other hiker the whole day, a man with two dogs. He said they were "squirrel dogs" and that they had treed about six or eight squirrels that day. I thought that was pretty funny. From the parking area I took the Veach Gap trail through the little gap that gives it its name, then got on the Tuscarora Trail toward Little Crease Mountain. The first mile or so followed along Mill Run, a smaller tributary of Passage Creek, and there were lots of little waterfalls and a few fun crossings. Those were a little challenging but the rest of the hike was pretty easy, even the last bit up to the top of the ridge where the trail had two switchbacks. I spent a long time on the ridge but didn't go the rest of the way to Little Crease, figuring that the views couldn't be better than from where I stood, looking down on the South Fork of the Shenandoah River. I could hear a dog barking and geese honking and even the river flowing, over a mile away and 1400' below. It was amazing. This was one of the most beautiful hikes I've been on so far and I will definitely go back.
