				Signal Knob is the northernmost point on Massanutten Mountain. The day that I hiked up the weather was cool and cloudy with occasional light rain showers. That was good, because the loop I followed involves two separate ascents and the trail is extremely rocky in some places, requiring great care. The photo below was taken from an overlook a mile or two from the parking area along the Massanutten/Signal Knob trail. From this spot at about 1550' elevation one can see Buzzard Rock across the valley, nearly a mile away and over 200' below.
