				Strickler Knob is a rocky outcrop on the easternmost ridge of Massanutten Mountain that rises about 2000' above the Shenandoah Valley. It is readily accessed via the Scothorn Gap trail, parking at the trailhead on Crisman Hollow Road (FR 274). On this day the fall foliage was spectacular and the weather was warm and pleasant. The picture below faces roughly southwest and shows the New Market Gap at the far right of the image; US 211 can be seen near the left edge. This is one of the most beautiful spots on Massanutten Mountain and a favorite hike for me because of the views and the relative solitude compared to the more popular destinations in Shenandoah National Park.
