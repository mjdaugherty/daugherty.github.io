				The main draw of Duncan Knob, in my opinion, is not the views (though they are spectacular) but the fun scramble to the summit. It is most readily accessed from Crisman Hollow Road (FR 274) via the Gap Creek Trail, which heads up the mountain for about a mile before intersecting the white-blazed Duncan Knob trail that leads to the boulder field that must be navigated to reach the summit proper. Most of these boulders are a little smaller than a compact car and weigh perhaps 5 to 10 tons. Even so, they can shift under a hiker's weight, so climbing over them for a few hundred feet is not to be taken lightly. But it is a really fun scramble and one is rewarded with awesome views at the top. The photo shows Jawbone Gap, just to the right of center, and The Knob, the southern end of Short Mountain, behind.
