				Kennedy Peak is a long but relatively easy hike from the parking area at the head of the Stephens and the Massanutten Mountain trails. The elevation gain is about 1300' from this location. There is another parking area on SR 675 that cuts about a mile of hiking one way and 500' of elevation gain, but I didn't know that parking was allowed there so I did the longer version. It was about 6.8 miles out and back; most of it was not very rocky or steep and not terribly exciting, but the views from the summit were well worth the long walk, even though the weather was cloudy and there was even a bit of snow falling. There is a fire tower/shelter that allows one to see over most of the trees at the summit. The tallest peak in the photo is Duncan Knob, and the gap on the right side is Moreland Gap, which lies about 1000' lower than the small mountains on either side and is over three miles from Kennedy Peak.
