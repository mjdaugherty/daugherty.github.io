				This was an interesting hike. I had spent some time looking at Google Earth and found an unnamed peak near the Scothorn Gap trail. It looked easily accessible, being only maybe 300 yards off the trail and curiously devoid of trees. Once I actually got out there and got off the trail I understood why. There were burnt stumps everywhere and the "empty" field I had seen on Google Earth was actually overgrown with thorny plants. They were over my head and very thick and I had to use a long stick to push them out of the way to clear a temporary path for myself. To the best of my knowledge, bushwhacking isn't forbidden in the National Forest, but it is discouraged. In this case the undergrowth was so thick that I don't believe I did any significant damage, but if I had instead found a meadow full of wildflowers I wouldn't have gone through it. It took me nearly an hour to get through the field of thorny plants and reach the steep cliffs, which I scrambled up to reach the summit, where I found a fire pit and saw a young buck, who seemed unconcerned about my presence.
